                    <p>It originated from <b>Mexican silver miners</b> in the 18 th century. Gunpowder was wrapped in a paper like a <i>“taquito”</i> and inserted into rocks before detonation. By this time, tacos were known as the food of the working class, which included miners. This resulted in their portable street food being called “tacos de minero“, also known as “miners tacos”.</p>
